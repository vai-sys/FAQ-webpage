                    <p>"I think what makes me unique is my ability to meet and exceed deadlines without sacrificing accuracy in my work. In my previous role, my manager consistently praised me for completing the quarterly status reports early and with a high level of quality. This allowed me to take on additional responsibilities and eventually led to my promotion."</p>

                    <p>“I’ve been a bookkeeper for the past three years where I track accounts payable and receivable, as well as oversee payroll. I’ve been able to find and resolve discrepancies between amounts owed and received, which has ended up saving our company thousands of dollars in underpaid bills. I recently earned my CPA degree and think my experience with bookkeeping and attention to detail would make me a great fit for your open public accountant role.”

I’m always looking for ways to lower my own carbon footprint.”</p>
